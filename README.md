# vrGenie
The idea is to  build a mobile app which an user can subscribe at the time of booking. For example lets assume a user is booking a VR using a OTA during the booking process he can opt to get an mobile app named as “Your Genie”.If a user opts the app he will get a download link directly to his mobile so that he can download and install the app in his mobile.The following will be highlights of the app     Welcome Pack: Gives the user the detailed info of the VR where the emergency exit,first aid boxes are available etc.  Provides the user with local activities/events.  Provides the user with local sightseeing details.  Provides the user with emergency numbers etc. Complaint App:   A way where user can raise complaints and get it resolved.  This part should be connected with a CRM(Need to identify a good CRM for this)   Feedback App: Provides a way using which he can provide feedback about his stay and share the same in Social Network Apps IOT:   Have control button on all the devices available in that VR.Right from opening the door to switching on/off lights,tv,owens,AC etc etc..
